  - elpa: packages installed from elpa
  - non-elpa: manually installed pakcages
  - src/elisp: elisp code

* Configuration for different boxes
  There should be a file called `vars-user.el` in this directory. And
  in that file, a variable named `vars-user` should be defined, like
  how `vars-default` and `vars-full` are defined in
  `src/elisp/init-vars.el`.
